# chimeraos-hack-tools
These tools are to be used by those who are serious about wanting to tweak ChimeraOS for whatever intended purpose. If you break your install, it's not my fault. You've been warned. The basis of this repo is to host some QoL scripts to automate some of the tasks that are annoying to do by hand.

Some hacks include changing kernel parameters, installing linux-mainline, and possibly more in time.
